Thunderbird Custom Styles

In Thunderbird:

1.  **Menu > **Help > **Troubleshooting Information

2.  Under the "Application Basics" section, where it says "Profile Folder", Click "Open Folder (Local Drive)"

3.  A new window opens showing the contents of your Profile folder.

4.  Close Thunderbird now - this is important.

5.  Create new folder and call it "chrome" note the spelling - use a lower case 'c' It should be in the same place as the 'Mail' folder.

6.  Download the userChrome.css style file in this repository and copy it into that folder. 

7.  Start Thunderbird.

8.  If the fonts are still too small for you, then look for this line:

   * { font-size: 14px !important; }
   
and change the 14px to say 16px etc

9.  Save the changes

10. Start Thunderbird.
