Thunderbird Custom Styles

In Thunderbird:

Help > Troubleshooting Information

Under the "Application Basics" section, where it says "Profile Folder", Click "Open Folder (Local Drive)"

A new window opens showing the contents of your Profile folder.

Close Thunderbird now - this is important.

Create new folder and call it "chrome" note the spelling - use a lower case 'c' It should be in the same place as the 'Mail' folder.

Download the userChrome.css style file and copy it into that folder

If the fonts are still too small for you, then look for this line:

   * { font-size: 14px !important; }
   
and change the 14px to say 16px etc

Save the changes

Start Thunderbird.

See images as guide.
